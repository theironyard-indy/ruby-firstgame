      <h3>Course Description</h3>
      <p>The Build Your First Game course will cover the Ruby programming language from the ground up to a functional command line game or two. </p>

<p>Along the way, you'll learn about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Variables </li>
<li>Classes<br>
</li>
<li>Functions<br>
</li>
<li>Blocks<br>
</li>
<li>Data Structures<br>
</li>
<li>Handling user input</li>
</ul>

<p>Of note: We won't be delving into Ruby on Rails, the popular Ruby-based web application framework. Ruby itself is fun enough to fill an evening.</p>
